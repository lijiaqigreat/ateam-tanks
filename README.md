Tank Battles!
=============

A yet-to-be-officially-named 2D multiplayer tank combat game which could feature
AI enemies,
music and sound effects,
network play,
explosion physics,
and anything else we come up with!

This game will be a unique blend of turn-based and real-time gameplay elements.

We are writing the game as a desktop application in Java and
a not-yet-chosen media framework (likely SDL).
